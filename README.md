Traffic Management System
The Traffic Management System is a simple C++ console-based application designed to simulate a traffic light control system. It provides an interactive menu-driven interface that allows users to view instructions for traffic light signals (Red, Yellow, Green), access basic traffic rules and regulations, and handle emergency vehicle scenarios. The program is structured to loop until the user chooses to exit, making it an intuitive tool for learning about traffic management basics.
Features

Traffic Light Instructions: Displays commands for Red (Stop), Yellow (Prepare to Go), and Green (Go) lights.
Traffic Rules: Lists essential traffic rules such as obeying signals, using seat belts, and avoiding mobile phone use while driving.
Emergency Vehicle Handling: Instructs users to pull over for emergency vehicles.
User-Friendly Menu: Provides a clear menu with options and validates user input, ensuring a smooth experience.
Exit Option: Allows users to exit the program cleanly.
